* Orders by overall total.
* You can choose which of the 3 social counts to include.
* For beginners, it is very easy to install with no necessary customisation.

== Installation ==

The steps to install 'Most Shared Posts' are quite simple:

1. Upload `most-shared-posts` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the 'Widgets' page in the 'Appearance' section of WordPress
4. Now you can add the widget to different pages of your site. Recommended pages to add the widget: "Sidebar Index", "Sidebar Single", "Sidebar Category"
5. You can customise the plugin differently for each of these sections should you wish.
6. NOTE: The plugin throttles how quickly it gathers the social data, to ensure it does not cause any slowness for your users. For small sites with less than 100 posts, this should typically be done in the first hour. For sites with other 2000 posts it could take a day or more.
7. Now load a page on your blog which should show the widget. This will initiate the first data fetch.
